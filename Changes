  - Perforce escaping of meta-characters in selectors and test (rafl)
  - New Feature:  HTML::Zoom will autoload FilterBuilder functions so that
    you can avoid a bit of boilerplate in method calls.  Now you can replace:

        $z->select('div')->replace_content("Hello World");

    With:

        $z->replace_content(div => "Hello World");

  - Lots of changes to FilterBuilder so that functionality matched the docs
    better, improved the docs and added tests for documented functions to
    avoid future regressions.

  - add / to excluded characters in attribute names to correctly parse <br/>
  - add transform_attribute method (rbuels)
